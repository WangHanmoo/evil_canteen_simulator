# Evil Canteen Simulator

Evil Canteen Simulator is a short moral management simulation game built entirely with Python + Pygame.
You play as a school cafeteria manager for one day, every unethical decision darkens your “Heart Meter” — from red (pure) to gray (numb) to black (corrupted).

There are 4 possible endings, determined by how far your heart has decayed.
Can you discover them all?

# Gameplay Flow
1️⃣ Start Game → 2️⃣ Preparation Phase (buy ingredients, prep food)
→ 3️⃣ Business Phase (serve, clean, react to events)
→ 4️⃣ Incident Phase (complaints, inspections, bribes, layoffs)
→ 5️⃣ Moral Collapse 
→ 6️⃣ Ending Evaluation

# Theme & Inspiration
Evil Canteen Simulator draws inspiration from games like Papers, Please and Mr. TomatoS, exploring how routine decisions lead to moral decay.
The “Heart Meter” visualizes psychological collapse, making inner corruption visible and interactive.
